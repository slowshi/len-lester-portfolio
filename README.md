# Len Lester's Portfolio

This is my portfolio website. I wanted to keep it simple and list the things that I've done in the past with links to my resume and other socials.

I chose Monokai as the theme for the site. With any new experience, I'll add to my projects JSON. That's pretty much it.

### Stack

- Vite
- React
- Tailwind

### Todo

- Work Experience?
- Picture of me?
- Update my resume?
