# Len Lester's Portfolio

This is my portfolio website. I wanted to keep it simple and list the things that I've done in the past with links to my resume and other socials.

I chose Monokai as the theme for the site. It's being deployed on vercel. All information can be updated in the constants file.

### Stack

- Vite
- React
- Tailwind

### Todo

- Picture of me?
- Update my resume?
- Open source it in the future?
